# Future Work

- Naming: I need to improve on how I assign names to variables, classes, fields etc. so they don't overlap
- Minifying code: C# syntax has been updated to help make code less wordy. I need to learn about these updates so that I can write code that does more with fewer lines.
- Pacing: This time, I did not pace myself well when I started learning. I will improve by making my studying more modular.
